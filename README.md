# Connect-4-env

## Available Players

This library provides a collection of Connect Four bots with different skill levels. These bots can be used for various purposes, such as:

- **Learning by playing against them**: You can improve your AI model by playing against these bots, which range from beginner to advanced levels.
- **Comparing the level of self-learning models**: By playing against these bots, you can evaluate the performance of your self-learning model and position it in terms of skill level and elo.

You can integrate players as opponents in your gym environment like this:

```python
env = ConnectFourEnv(opponent=BabyPlayer())
```

### Player Descriptions

- **MinMaxPlayer**: An implementation of the Minimax algorithm. Can be used with different search depths (e.g., `MinMaxPlayer(depth=3)`), but it is very slow, so it is not recommended for general use. All other algorithms are much faster.

- **BabyPlayer**: Plays random moves.

- **ChildPlayer**: Plays random moves, but if there is a winning move, it will play it.

- **ChildSmarterPlayer**: Same as ChildPlayer, but if there is a move that would make the opponent win, it will play that move to block the opponent.

- **TeenagerPlayer**: Same as ChildSmarterPlayer, but excludes moves that would allow the opponent to win if they play on top of it.

- **TeenagerSmarterPlayer**: Same as TeenagerPlayer, but checks if a move creates a line of three tokens with available spaces on both sides. If so, it will play that move.

- **AdultPlayer**: Same as TeenagerSmarterPlayer, but also checks if a move creates a line of three tokens with available spaces on both sides for the opponent. If so, it will play that move to block the opponent.

- **AdultSmarterPlayer**: Same as AdultPlayer, but checks if a move allows to create multiple ways to win and plays that move. Also checks if a move allows the opponent to create multiple ways to win and plays that move to protect itself.

- **ConsolePlayer**: Asks for moves to play in the console. Perfect for testing your own AI.
